            <p class="browser" > In my 15 years of work experience, I have been privileged 
                enough to get exposure in a variety of industries.<br>
                Through all my experiences , the one thing I have understood
                is  that companies aren't always able to secure budgets that can put<br>
                development teams at work to build tools that can make life easier 
                for both staff and line managers. This has made me think of things in <br>
                a different manner and structure my skill set towards automation. Automation
                alongside soft tools either built on excel or Access or even HTML can make a<br>
                world of a difference in how small teams do work and yield results. 
                I have the necessary expertise to populate HTML forms that can take in<br>
                captured information or uploaded documents, write the information into a 
                database and link all of that to a reporting tool through ETLâ€™s or not depending<br>
                on what the business requires. This usually happens after proper needs analysis
                and a clear understanding of the core departments duties. <br>
                I have always been proud to provide the assistance that makes good managers great. 

                I am also always looking for new technologies to improve my skillset as well as make 
                myself as competitive as possible, to be able to provide the best technical assistance <br>
                possible for those who entrust me with any project, or with employment. Currently not employed
                in a technical role, I am always starting personal projects in Databases, ETL Tools, Python, <br>
                tableau and much more. Recently I have been involved in a few Django projects, that can assist 
                with writing data to a dba and providing real-time reporting. The project is not yet complete <br>
                yet the progress has been completely fulfilling.
