                    With data science and machine learning advancing at the slow pace at which it is, I think it is clear to a lot in the industry
                    that the field isnt growing as exponential as it was previously predicted and I suspect it is becoming we need to get better as 
                    data professionals at unpacking it in its entirety. 

                    I am quite excited to keep learning more about how to best deliver machine learning on python and R. I am looking forward to finding
                    more projects that I can use to expand my knowledge, add value to a contractors life as well as just dive deep into the 
                    linear algebra to keep unpacking. Who knows, maybe soon enough, I will be teaching more people how to easily use Machine learning.
